Javascript is a kind of compiled language, its not the same as Java, here we dont send out binary compiled code,
instead it compiles every single time it runs on the browser
Actually JS is interpreted langauge, However interpreted languages are also human readable languages and needs
 a translation down to machine languages to get executed, but this translation is done at runtime.
